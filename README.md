## [FOREST FOR THE TREES](https://forest-for-the-trees-fc1180a8c5b1.herokuapp.com/)

### Description:

**_FOREST FOR THE TREES_** is a web application that brings the woods to you. The Pacific Northwest has so many amazing trees as part of its environment. This app gives a small sliver of the trees that are native to the state of Oregon. Learn about some of the trees that you may have seen while driving down the road or out on the trail. Users will be able to get some basic info about these wonderful trees and post comments on them if they feel so inclined. Get lost in the woods.

## ðŸŒ± The Code to Seed the Database

</div>

```js
// Function to insert seed data into the database
const seedDatabase = async () => {
  try {
    // Remove existing tree data
    await Tree.deleteMany({});
    // Insert the seed data
    await Tree.create(data.trees);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error inserting seed data:", error);
  }
};
```

<div align='center'>

#### This code block was my favorite because I can not think of a more relevant code necessary for an app that involves trees. I was unable to find an API that had a tree database that would be able to populate my app. So I used a book called "The Sibley Guide to Trees". I was able to find 27 different trees native to Oregon within the book and pick out certain characteristics that are used in tree identification. From there I had to build an array of objects with different properties for each tree. Once the database was filld out I used the "seedDatabase" function to clear out anything within the mongoose database and then create a new database that compiled all of the tree data that I had placed within its own file. Once "node seed.js" was run the this function was run and a new databse was accessible to be displayed in the app.

## Plans for the future:

While this app is very simple so far, it was a great experience for me to understand how dynamic express.js can be and I look forward to adding onto this app in the future and even building my own tree data API.

- [ ] ADD MORE REGIONS WITH NEW TREE DATA SO PEOPLE CAN LEARN ABOUT THE TREES ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
- [ ] ADD IMMERSIVE FOREST SOUNDS SO THE USER CAN BE TRANSPORTED TO THE FOREST FROM THEIR DESKTOP OR DEVICE.
- [ ] ADD PHOTOS OF EACH TREE SO THE USER CAN VISUALIZE WHAT THE TREE ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE.
- [ ] PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT EACH TREE FOR FURTHER KNOWLEDGE.
- [ ] ALLOW USERS TO POST PHOTOS WITHIN THE NETWORKS PAGE IF THEY'VE SEEN THE TREE OR FROM THEIR ADVENTURES OUT ON THE TRAIL.
- [ ] ADD PLANT LIFE AND WILDLIFE TO THE APP PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FOREST ECOSYSTEMS.
- [ ] PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT TREE CARE AND MAINTENANCE IF THE USER EVER DECIDES TO PLANT TREES OF THEIR OWN.
- [ ] PROVIDE MAPS OF CERTAIN AREAS WHERE THESE TREES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SEEN.
